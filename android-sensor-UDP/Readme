Sensor UDP allows the user to send sensor data wirelessly via UDP on their Android device. Users can use this sensor data for a wide variety of motion tracking applications, or simply read-out the sensor data from their phone.
• Includes support for Linear Acceleration, Gravity, Rotation, Orientation, Ambient Light and Proximity sensors
• Displays sensor values on screen during wireless transmission
• Checks device for sensor availability. It is important to note that not all devices support all sensors.
• Includes a keyboard to 'create notes' for performance
• Values are stored in a float array, with ordering consistent to the user interface.

Sensor UDP Usage Instructions:
Input the ip address of the local machine displayed in the table DAT "connection"
Input the port number displayed in the table DAT "connection" (Port 6000 is chosen by default)
Access button keyboard from the menu in the top right corner of the app
